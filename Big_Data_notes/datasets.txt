registerTempTable is a part of the 1.x API and has been deprecated in Spark 2.0.
createOrReplaceTempView and createTempView have been introduced in Spark 2.0, as a replacement for registerTempTable.
Other than that registerTempTable and createOrReplaceTempView functionally equivalent and the former one calls the latter one.

** DataSets  **


Dataset can be converted into DataFrame by calling ds.toDF() method
Supports lambda expressions and offers high performance
Dataset is introduced from Spark 1.6 version onwards
Special encoder does the job of mapping Dataset with the schema


val price = List(100,300,500,800,1000).toDS();
val price_after_discount = price.map(r=>r*0.8)


val sqlContext = new org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext(sc);
val Cust_Info = sc.textFile("/HDFSPath/Customer.txt");
case class Customer(custid: String,firstname: String,lastname:String,age:Int,profession:String);
val DS = Cust_Info.map(_.split(",")).map(c => Customer(c(0),c(1),c(2),c(3).toInt,c(4)).toDS();
DS.createOrReplaceTempView("customer");
val pilotavg= sqlContext.sql("SELECT profession,AVG(age) FROM customer group by profession");
pilotavg.show();
